// Package pmw (Parallel MultiWriter) contains an implementation of an "io.Writer" that
// duplicates it's writes to all the provided writers, similar to the Unix
// tee(1) command. Writers can be added and removed dynamically after creation. Each write is
// done in a separate goroutine, so the writes are done in parallel. This package is useful
// when you want to write to multiple writers at the same time, but don't want to block on
// each write. Errors that may occur are gathered and returned after all writes are done.
//
// Example:
//
//	package main
//
//	import (
//		"os"
//		"lib/pmw"
//	)
//
//	func main() {
//		w := multiwriter.New(os.Stdout, os.Stderr)
//
//		w.Write([]byte("written to stdout AND stderr\n"))
//
//		w.Remove(os.Stderr)
//
//		w.Write([]byte("written to ONLY stdout\n"))
//
//		w.Remove(os.Stdout)
//		w.Add(os.Stderr)
//
//		w.Write([]byte("written to ONLY stderr\n"))
//	}
